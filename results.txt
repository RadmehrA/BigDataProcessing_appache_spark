\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 This project showcased the capabilities of Apache Spark in processing large datasets, specifically analyzing user activity logs. The analysis revealed the most active users based on their session activity, which highlighted engagement trends across the user base. By grouping the data by user ID and counting session occurrences, we were able to identify the top users, providing valuable insights for potential targeted interventions or marketing strategies.\
Furthermore, we calculated the average session duration for users, which illustrated typical engagement times. This metric is essential for understanding user behavior and identifying potential areas for improvement in user experience. Additionally, we filtered the data to remove anomalies, specifically sessions that exceeded 12 hours, which could indicate errors or unusual behavior patterns. This analysis demonstrated that Apache Spark is not only efficient for large-scale data processing but also effective in deriving meaningful insights from complex datasets.\
